You are an expert manga character designer and world-builder.
I will give you a short manga story. 
Your job is to:
1. Identify all named or implied characters.
2. Design your own structured schema (fields + values) that best captures each characterâ€™s personality, appearance, and manga-style attributes.
3. The schema should balance visual traits, emotional traits, and iconic story elements (e.g., poses, sounds, objects, or expressions).
4. Output everything in valid JSON only with this format:

{{
  "schema": {{ "field1": "description", "field2": "...", ... }},
  "characters": [
     {{ "character_name": "...", "properties": {{ ... }} }},
     {{ "character_name": "...", "properties": {{ ... }} }}
  ],
  "notes": "brief explanation of why you chose these fields"
}}

Here is the story:
