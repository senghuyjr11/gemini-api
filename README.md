# Manga Prompt Agent & Gemini API Integration

A Python toolkit to create, customize, and refine prompts for manga generation, with support for leveraging the Gemini API as part of your prompt engineering workflow.

## Overview

This repository is designed for manga creators and AI artists who want to systematically generate high-quality prompts for manga (or anime-style) image generation. It provides modules to help you:

- Compose, structure, and refine prompts specifically for manga agents.
- Optionally use Googleâ€™s Gemini API to enhance or expand prompt ideas.
- Prepare prompts for direct use in diffusion models or other generative AI pipelines.

## Features

- Tools for manga/anime prompt creation and editing
- Gemini API integration for smart prompt enhancement (optional)
- Workflow to prepare prompts for manga diffusion models
- 100% Python, easy to integrate into your existing projects
